                <h3>Joey Tribbiany & Pheobe Buffay</h3>
                <p>Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members.</p>
                <p>Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal, complete childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards still a child at heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise.</p>
                <p>Phoebe and Joey kissed several times throughout the show's 10 seasons, including sharing a 'perfect' smooch in one episode. Later in the show, which ran until 2004, when Joey thought Phoebe was pregnant, he even proposed to his love interest - although nothing materialised from it.</p>
